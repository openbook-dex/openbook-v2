# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Openbook V2 repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests. Similarly, please don't disclose vulnerability details in Discord channels, including our own.**

Instead, please send an email to contact[@]openbook-solana.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., theft of funds, freezing user funds, or arithmetic over/underflows)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

While we don't have a formally established bug bounty program, we welcome security research and will
work with researchers to explore bounty options.
